# FirstProject

This project is designed to manage and track ship docking activities efficiently. It provides functionalities to:

- Accept input for the number of cargo and cruise ships docking per day.
- Ensure that the maximum docking capacity is not exceeded.
- Calculate daily and weekly anchoring fees for docked ships.
- Compute the total cargo profit based on the number of containers transported.


This system helps optimize port operations by maintaining accurate records and preventing overcapacity issues.
